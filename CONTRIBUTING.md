# Contributing to MediaWiktory

Currently, MediaWiktory at early stages of development (aka "young yet
useful"). Currenty problems and roadmap can be found at
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/molybdenum-99/mediawiktory/issues) and
are grouped into milestones.

Therefore, the big picture of "what next" is:
* more documentation for generated MediaWiki wrappers (both YARD and
  on-the-fly accessible from code);
* more validations and cleaner errors;
* simplification of frequent and common tasks.

You can join MediaWiktory development by usual fork-commit-pull request
process, or by providing your own cases and problems you'd like to solve
with it.
